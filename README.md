# GSiege
Guild Wars 2 Automated WvW Siege Tool

Provides an automated method for operating siege weaponry within the Guild Wars 2 World vs. World environment and compatible maps. Currently supports the Flame Ram (with and without Mastery III), the Catapult, and the Trebuchet. Values can be directly modified in the GUI interface to tweak the settings. Settings autosave on exit for recovery on next run.

The 1.5 version adds support for an AFK idle bot, expanded control over the bot, single fire options, and a simplified interface to abstract out the advanced settings. The default settings have been tweaked to account for some server lag when zergs are present, and the RNG has been expanded to provide a more robust solution for detection evasion.


*What this is*:
- A program to help you avoid hours of holding the 2 key to knock open Stonemist.
- A program for helping you fire more accurate and consistent shots with trebs and cats.
- A program for the enjoyment of watching automation tools.

*What this is* **NOT**:
- An autowin tool for infinitrebbing while you sleep.
- An arrow cart tool.
- A shield generator tool.
- A siege golem tool.
- Any other silly uses you can come up with.


The source code is provided open-source to allow the community to learn some of the methods for bypassing detection, as well as show some examples of automation tricks to better interact with 3rd-party software (low level keystroke injection, linked lists, etc.). The program is also written by hand entirely in C, and the interface has been streamlined for memory and speed efficiency. 

The program runs entirely within approximately 1MB worth of memory, and a strong focus is placed on maintaining a minimal footprint. Binaries will be provided here, but if you do not trust them then you are welcome to compile the tool yourself. It is designed to be as close to a turnkey solution as possible. The free Visual Studio Community edition will quickly compile the program with ease. Just open the .sln file in Visual Studio, and press F7.
